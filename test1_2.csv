Given the COVID -19 pandemic, we have paused our hiring plans until Q4.
Although we are hiring a very few critical reqs, our team is doing this
through direct sourcing as we have kept all our agencies we work with on
hold until further notice (to optimize cost more effectively for this
year).
With this, we are also not looking at making any changes to our current
empanelment this year, however, if anything changes in the near future,
will surely reconnect with you. Else, we can reconnect sometime next year
in Q1 to explore if we can partner with your organisation.
