2980,SeekingMoreInfo, I refer to your contact with Noel Clifford in Darwin. We already have an number of established relationships with specialists recruiters both in our local state and territory and interstate. Thank you for your interest in recruiting for Nexia Edwards Marshall NT. Here is how we work with recruiters and if you wish to work with us you will need to align to this following:  1.  We will always advertise ourselves on Seek  2.  For a minimum period of at least 2 weeks following our advertising we will not accept any candidates from recruiters  3.  We do not accept candidates from recruiters unless they have sent through their Terms of Business and rates.  4.  We do not accept candidates from recruiters for graduate entry level roles or support staff roles - only experience professional staff  5.  We do not enter into exclusive relationships with recruiters but maintain positive relationships with a number of recruiters.   Therefore we will not sign an exclusive service agreement.  6.  We will not use recruiters that charge more than 17 on roles under 140000 pkg - the recruiter we work with the most charges us 12 but most others are around 15-17  7.  If you have a suitable candidate you need to send through a brief outline generally without a name so I can advise whether we are interested in seeing the candidate or not.  8.  We will not accept resumes sent through unsolicited when no role has been advertised or a brief outline sent for our review.  9.  Partners  Senior staff are not to be sent resumes directly as we receive candidates from a number of sources and often duplicates and endeavour to honour the first source. Please ensure that you update your records with myself as the primary contact and no further approaches are made to the partners.

3922,Unsubscribed,this is  the last  reminder. Your system  has been  hacked. All the  data from  your device  were copied  to our  servers. Besides a video  was recorded  from your  camera wle  you were  watcng porn. My  virus infected  your device  via an  adult website  that you  visited  recently. If you  dont know  how that  works I  will provide  the details. The  trojan virus  provides me  full access  as well  as control of  the device  you are  using. As a  result I  can see  your screen  turn on  the camera  and microphone  wle you  wont know about  it. I captured  a video  from your  screen and  the camera  of the  device. I  edited a  video wherein  one part  of  the screen  there is  a video  of you  masturbating and  in the  other a  pornograpc video  that you  opened at  that time. I can  see all  the contacthis  from your  phone and  all of  your social  networks. At one  moment I  can send  this video  to all the  contacthis on  your phone  email and  social networks. Moreover  I can  also send  your email  and messenger  data to  everybody. I can  destroy  your reputation  forever. If you  want to  avoid this  then:Send 1300  USD USA  dollars to  my bitcoin  walletif you  dont know  how to do  that search  xe2x80x9cbuy bitcoinxe2x80x9d  using Google. My  BTC wallet:  bc1qlvvlndet2efvafwt6tjcqq9shshpx606llh0xdAs soon  as I  receive the  payment I  will destroy  your video  and guarantee not  to disturb  you ever  again. You have  50 hours  a little  more than  2 days  to complete  this payment. I  receive an  automatic  notification that  this email  has been  read. Likewise  the timer  will automatically  start after  you read  the current  email. Dont try  to complain anywhere  since the  wallet cannot  be tracked  in any  way the  email from  wch this  mail came  is also  cant be  tracked  and is  created automatically  so there  is no  point in  replying to  me. If you  try to  share this  letter with  anyone the  system  will automatically  send a  request to  the servers  and servers  will start  sending all  of the  data to  the social  networks. Changing passwords in  social networks  email devices  wont help  since all  the data  has already  been downloaded  to my  servers cluster. I  wish you  good  luck and  dont do  anytng stupid.  think about  your reputation.
