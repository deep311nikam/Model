Cloud migrations have soared over the last year to ensure businesscontinuity and accelerate transformations.Although the public cloud is a central pillar of everyonexe2u20acu2122s digitaltransformation strategy attempting to migrate all applications andinfrastructure to a single cloud provider risks cost overruns and outrightmigration failure.72 of companies who have migrated to the public cloud report that they haverepatriated at least onemajor application on-premise.What your customers need instead is to deploy applications into the bestlocation possible and integrate them across on-premises your private cloudand the public cloud. The market for such hybrid cloud services is growingrapidly and is expected to reach USD 145 billion.The big question is as a data center managed services and private cloudleader are you able to provide this hybrid cloud capabilityIt is extraordinarily difficult to integrate multiple clouds or public cloudswith on-premise and private cloud locations.
