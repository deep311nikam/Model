The last time of our discussion, I remember, the country manager wanted specific feedback so that she makes up her decision. Am not sure whether this was possible. Secondly, the project is drawing to a close, I highly doubt whether farmer registration would be taken up in the last 1.5 years of the project.
Given the above scenario, we could keep in touch just incase we get next phase of funding from the donor. Currently, though, we are looking at different modalities of implementation. This approach could inform our next programing activities.

3019,SeekingMoreInfo,Thankyou for keeping me in mind for the role however as you are aware andcan clearly see with this position the pay structure has has alteredsignificantly with IR35.What would have usually been a position of around 5 to 600 per day ltd cois now a 50k a year salary.This is a gap to far to bridge nowadays the take home pay no longerjustifies working away from home.Sadly I feel this is now the new norm and companies are going to expectthe same service from guys like me for half the salary.For me it is far easier to work consultancy earning more staying out ofIR35 and sleeping in my own bed In short these clients are no longer prepared to pay the going rate forguys like me any more this doesnt leave us any alternative other than tofind other revenue streams to suit the experience and qualifications.Infact this role is a perfect example I dare say on 10 hour days workingwith a Saturday the standby fire Watcher and fork lift driver would be onmore earnings than the PM......I would be interested in your thoughts.
