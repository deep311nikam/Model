They have shared thatdata security is their number one concern. A hybrid cloud solution that targetsapplication workloads into the right location based on security needs costperformance and business outcomes is the holy grail.When computing and processing demand fluctuates hybrid cloud computing givesbusinesses the ability to burst into the public cloud to handle any overflowwhilst retaining control over where their data resides.With Protocloud you can 1. Target application workloads into the best location for security cost or performance but without even more migration or refactoring. 2. Drastically simplify IT architecture team and tools. 3. Monitor the health of every single application service deployed anywhere on-premise in the cloud at the edge across over 300 underlying infrastructure network and application-level metrics that can impact application health. 4. Ensure applications are always available by automatically recovering services into a healthy state.If this piques your interest can I ask for 10 minutes of your timeWarm

1629,ConnectLater, I refer to your contact with Noel Clifford in Darwin. We already have an number of established relationships with specialists recruiters both in our local state and territory and interstate. Thank you for your interest in recruiting for Nexia Edwards Marshall NT. Here is how we work with recruiters and if you wish to work with us you will need to align to this following:  1.  We will always advertise ourselves on Seek  2.  For a minimum period of at least 2 weeks following our advertising we will not accept any candidates from recruiters  3.  We do not accept candidates from recruiters unless they have sent through their Terms of Business and rates.  4.  We do not accept candidates from recruiters for graduate entry level roles or support staff roles - only experience professional staff  5.  We do not enter into exclusive relationships with recruiters but maintain positive relationships with a number of recruiters.   Therefore we will not sign an exclusive service agreement.  6.  We will not use recruiters that charge more than 17 on roles under 140000 pkg - the recruiter we work with the most charges us 12 but most others are around 15-17  7.  If you have a suitable candidate you need to send through a brief outline generally without a name so I can advise whether we are interested in seeing the candidate or not.  8.  We will not accept resumes sent through unsolicited when no role has been advertised or a brief outline sent for our review.  9.

5234,ConnectLater,Well to be honest these dont help. SOC2 certificate of your data centers FIPS140-2 certified and validated cipher suites HIPAA compliance are the basic requirements. These are all US specific regulations and on top of that no US PHI data can be moved outside of the USA. To stir it further USA has a terrible network infrastructure. We need at least 3 main data centers and about 20 edge endpoints in order to reach to a meaningful response time after all we are doing soft-realtime EEG recordings. This requires hefty infrastructure dedicated barebone network traffic shaping reverse HTTP Proxying at the edge endpoints to isolate DDoS attacks and so on and so fort. We opted out from using Google and declined using a dedicated offer from IBM and not found Azure a good match either. Said that we are a very picky customer with a hefty expectations not only on the network but also on computing services managed databases multiple storage classes for long time storage rolling updates etc. I am afraid Artera is not in that league as of yet.

2190,Unsubscribed,this is  the last  reminder. Your system  has been  hacked. All the  data from  your device  were copied  to our  servers. Besides a video  was recorded  from your  camera wle  you were  watcng porn. My  virus infected  your device  via an  adult website  that you  visited  recently. If you  dont know  how that  works I  will provide  the details. The  trojan virus  provides me  full access  as well  as control of  the device  you are  using. As a  result I  can see  your screen  turn on  the camera  and microphone  wle you  wont know about  it. I captured  a video  from your  screen and  the camera  of the  device. I  edited a  video wherein  one part  of  the screen  there is  a video  of you  masturbating and  in the  other a  pornograpc video  that you  opened at  that time. I can  see all  the contacthis  from your  phone and  all of  your social  networks. At one  moment I  can send  this video  to all the  contacthis on  your phone  email and  social networks. Moreover  I can  also send  your email  and messenger  data to  everybody. I can  destroy  your reputation  forever. If you  want to  avoid this  then:Send 1300  USD USA  dollars to  my bitcoin  walletif you  dont know  how to do  that search  xe2x80x9cbuy bitcoinxe2x80x9d  using Google. My  BTC wallet:  bc1qlvvlndet2efvafwt6tjcqq9shshpx606llh0xdAs soon  as I  receive the  payment I  will destroy  your video  and guarantee not  to disturb  you ever  again. You have  50 hours  a little  more than  2 days  to complete  this payment. I  receive an  automatic  notification that  this email  has been  read. Likewise  the timer  will automatically  start after  you read  the current  email. Dont try  to complain anywhere  since the  wallet cannot  be tracked  in any  way the  email from  wch this  mail came  is also  cant be  tracked  and is  created automatically  so there  is no  point in  replying to  me. If you  try to  share this  letter with  anyone the  system  will automatically  send a  request to  the servers  and servers  will start  sending all  of the  data to  the social  networks. Changing passwords in  social networks  email devices  wont help  since all  the data  has already  been downloaded  to my  servers cluster. I  wish you  good  luck and  dont do  anytng stupid.  think about  your reputation.

Cloud migrations have soared over the last year to ensure businesscontinuity and accelerate transformations.Although the public cloud is a central pillar of everyonexe2u20acu2122s digitaltransformation strategy attempting to migrate all applications andinfrastructure to a single cloud provider risks cost overruns and outrightmigration failure.72 of companies who have migrated to the public cloud report that they haverepatriated at least onemajor application on-premise.What your customers need instead is to deploy applications into the bestlocation possible and integrate them across on-premises your private cloudand the public cloud. The market for such hybrid cloud services is growingrapidly and is expected to reach USD 145 billion.The big question is as a data center managed services and private cloudleader are you able to provide this hybrid cloud capabilityIt is extraordinarily difficult to integrate multiple clouds or public cloudswith on-premise and private cloud locations. This requires complexarchitectural components including service discovery monitoring DNSarchitecture network configuration and a variety of other integrations.European MSPs are effortlessly deploying hybrid cloud architectures andupgrading their private cloud capabilities with cutting-edge Kubernetes andcontainer deployments by using ProtoCloud.The platform takes a radically different approach to deploying applications andinfrastructure together whether on-premise into a private cloud the publiccloud or edge locations. It simplifies deployments with pre-integrated toolingand more.ProtoCloud helps companies accelerate migrating and modernizing applicationswithout imposing an all-or-nothing migration or a complete redevelopment. Allthis in a single well-architected platform.If this piques your interest can we ask for 10 minutes in your diary to helpyou offer these capabilities to your customersWarm

Sir my friend told me that she have gone through your catalog  productdetails but I regret to inform you that she have cancelled to buy thisproduct from India as her customer has turn down the offer to import thisproduct from India due to customer terms and conditions etc. and she hasplaced the order of the product from her source in Taiwan as it will bemore faster and cheap due to the urgency to maintain the contracts. I shallinform you in future whenever she has such demand again so bear with us. MEANWHILE  I HAVE ANOTHER URGENT SUPPLYING DEAL TO SHAREDISCUSS WITH YOUONLY  IF YOU WILL BE INTERESTED TO DO THE BUSINESS WITH ME AND WILLING TOACCEPT MY TERMS AND CONDITION IN THIS NEW BUSINESS  PROPOSAL AS I WILL LIKEUS TO ENTER INTO WRITING AGREEMENT TO BUILD MORE TRUST AS THIS WILL BE ALONG TIME BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND OUR COMPANY TO SOURCE ANDSUPPLY OUR COMPANY ANY VETERINARYHUMAN  RAW MATERIAL OUR COMPANY MAY NEEDFROM INDIA FOR PRODUCTIONS NOW AND IN FUTURE. Sir the business is to supply veterinaryPharmaceutical raw materials toour company upon their arrival in Indiain a large quantity on a monthlybasis. I have been supplying these veterinary Pharmaceutical raw materialsto our company with the assistance of an India business man  who based inDubai U. A. E but he use to visit India any time our company issue himpurchase order the business was going on smoothly between my-self andMr. Vivek E. Sharma but unfortunately am trying to reach him on his mobilenumbers for 2 month now but his Dubai India number was switch off due tohis greedy over our last supply as he seat on all my commission. Therefore  I need a reliable trustworthy business man whom I can trustthat understand India local language to help me and contact the IndiaCompany to know if they have enough of this chemicals in stock as ourcompany is ready to visit India for the business as soon as possible due tothe urgency these chemicals is not a bane product in India or here in UKas it fail into 100 herbal extract . Note that: this supply does not require any Import or export license fromyou because our company treated this business as a domestic transaction andsent their delegate to India for inspection payment. Your role is just to stand as a middle man between our company delegate andthe India companysupplier. You will buy the chemical from the Indiacompany which I will link you with and you will supply our company delegatewithout allowing them to meet or have each others contact due to the pricegap for our benefit and for future transactions.

I will also give you the contact of the India company where Mr. Vivek E. Sharma bought the exact specification in the past so that you will buy thechemicals from them and supply to our company delegate upon his arrival inIndia then we will share the profit  50-50 after the supplybusiness. I will influence our director  procurement department to pay you at least60 advance payment to source the total order value upon sample testing OKand the balance 40 before handing the chemicals over to our companydelegate in New Delhi India.

1900,SeekingMoreInfo,Is this a permanent role To change my track would also depend on thesalary and package. I am at present putting the programme together for the power generationplant at the Grange at present but it is not green as it is a diesel  gasplant and was somewhat surprised no green elements are employed like energyfrom waste a wind turbine or solar farm. I was tasked to look at potential workloads in Ireland and I am well awareof the requirements for increased generation required for the data centrespharma projects and distilleries. I know the River Shannon has numbers ofturbines on it and I expect this also could be further improved with moreefficient turbines and installations. This could also be further developedin the UK as a great deal of the mill streams still exist and it is puttingthem back into use instead of powering a mill but generating power. It would also be a point to also look at Elephant grass animal wastemethane and other agri fuels especially in Ireland. I also believe that there is a requirement that all warehouses shouldbecome solar farms and that car parks certainly at services should alsobecome farms allowing for the generation of power to feed electric cars. There are also future requirements in the cladding of buildings and themounting of turbines on buildings to also generate power with architecturalvisual blades and not just the standard propeller. There is a different vision that to have many small sources that feed thegrid instead of a dedicated number of large power stations feeding thepower supply. Please call me on 07702059469.
