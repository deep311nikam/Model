1264,ConnectLater,Thank you very much for your response to my inquiry in India-mart for areliable and verified supplier for the same as your product. I have a goodfriend who requested me to make this inquiry in India-martsense i havelittle idea in the India Market. Sir my friend told me that she have gone through your catalog  productdetails but I regret to inform you that she have cancelled to buy thisproduct from India as her customer has turn down the offer to import thisproduct from India due to customer terms and conditions etc. and she hasplaced the order of the product from her source in Taiwan as it will bemore faster and cheap due to the urgency to maintain the contracts. I shallinform you in future whenever she has such demand again so bear with us. MEANWHILE  I HAVE ANOTHER URGENT SUPPLYING DEAL TO SHAREDISCUSS WITH YOUONLY  IF YOU WILL BE INTERESTED TO DO THE BUSINESS WITH ME AND WILLING TOACCEPT MY TERMS AND CONDITION IN THIS NEW BUSINESS  PROPOSAL AS I WILL LIKEUS TO ENTER INTO WRITING AGREEMENT TO BUILD MORE TRUST AS THIS WILL BE ALONG TIME BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND OUR COMPANY TO SOURCE ANDSUPPLY OUR COMPANY ANY VETERINARYHUMAN  RAW MATERIAL OUR COMPANY MAY NEEDFROM INDIA FOR PRODUCTIONS NOW AND IN FUTURE. Sir the business is to supply veterinaryPharmaceutical raw materials toour company upon their arrival in Indiain a large quantity on a monthlybasis. I have been supplying these veterinary Pharmaceutical raw materialsto our company with the assistance of an India business man  who based inDubai U. A. E but he use to visit India any time our company issue himpurchase order the business was going on smoothly between my-self andMr. Vivek E. Sharma but unfortunately am trying to reach him on his mobilenumbers for 2 month now but his Dubai India number was switch off due tohis greedy over our last supply as he seat on all my commission. Therefore  I need a reliable trustworthy business man whom I can trustthat understand India local language to help me and contact the IndiaCompany to know if they have enough of this chemicals in stock as ourcompany is ready to visit India for the business as soon as possible due tothe urgency these chemicals is not a bane product in India or here in UKas it fail into 100 herbal extract . Note that: this supply does not require any Import or export license fromyou because our company treated this business as a domestic transaction andsent their delegate to India for inspection payment. Your role is just to stand as a middle man between our company delegate andthe India companysupplier. You will buy the chemical from the Indiacompany which I will link you with and you will supply our company delegatewithout allowing them to meet or have each others contact due to the pricegap for our benefit and for future transactions. I assured you that thisbusiness will not disturb your present workjob. I will use my position in the company and influence our director procurement department that you are the business partner to Mr. Vivek E. Sharma or distributor of the chemical company in India to enable ourcompany director to issue you purchase order in your favor and releaseadvance payment to you for bulk order after testing the sample. I will also give you the contact of the India company where Mr. Vivek E. Sharma bought the exact specification in the past so that you will buy thechemicals from them and supply to our company delegate upon his arrival inIndia then we will share the profit  50-50 after the supplybusiness. I will influence our director  procurement department to pay you at least60 advance payment to source the total order value upon sample testing OKand the balance 40 before handing the chemicals over to our companydelegate in New Delhi India. I personally came up with this idea toprotect my interest in the business. I will give you every necessary information you may need to make thebusiness successful as our company will send their delegate to Indiaimmediately for inspections and payment . If you are interested and willing to do the business with me then get backto me for more details. Please see attached here the scanned copy of our last purchase order issuedin the name of Mr. Vivek E. Sharma for your reference.

Cloud migrations have soared over the last year to ensure businesscontinuity and accelerate transformations.Although the public cloud is a central pillar of everyonexe2u20acu2122s digitaltransformation strategy attempting to migrate all applications andinfrastructure to a single cloud provider risks cost overruns and outrightmigration failure.72 of companies who have migrated to the public cloud report that they haverepatriated at least onemajor application on-premise.What your customers need instead is to deploy applications into the bestlocation possible and integrate them across on-premises your private cloudand the public cloud. The market for such hybrid cloud services is growingrapidly and is expected to reach USD 145 billion.The big question is as a data center managed services and private cloudleader are you able to provide this hybrid cloud capabilityIt is extraordinarily difficult to integrate multiple clouds or public cloudswith on-premise and private cloud locations. This requires complexarchitectural components including service discovery monitoring DNSarchitecture network configuration and a variety of other integrations.European MSPs are effortlessly deploying hybrid cloud architectures andupgrading their private cloud capabilities with cutting-edge Kubernetes andcontainer deployments by using ProtoCloud.The platform takes a radically different approach to deploying applications andinfrastructure together whether on-premise into a private cloud the publiccloud or edge locations. It simplifies deployments with pre-integrated toolingand more.ProtoCloud helps companies accelerate migrating and modernizing applicationswithout imposing an all-or-nothing migration or a complete redevelopment. Allthis in a single well-architected platform.If this piques your interest can we ask for 10 minutes in your diary to helpyou offer these capabilities to your customersWarm

2321,SeekingMoreInfo,Is this a permanent role To change my track would also depend on thesalary and package. I am at present putting the programme together for the power generationplant at the Grange at present but it is not green as it is a diesel  gasplant and was somewhat surprised no green elements are employed like energyfrom waste a wind turbine or solar farm. I was tasked to look at potential workloads in Ireland and I am well awareof the requirements for increased generation required for the data centrespharma projects and distilleries. I know the River Shannon has numbers ofturbines on it and I expect this also could be further improved with moreefficient turbines and installations. This could also be further developedin the UK as a great deal of the mill streams still exist and it is puttingthem back into use instead of powering a mill but generating power. It would also be a point to also look at Elephant grass animal wastemethane and other agri fuels especially in Ireland. I also believe that there is a requirement that all warehouses shouldbecome solar farms and that car parks certainly at services should alsobecome farms allowing for the generation of power to feed electric cars. There are also future requirements in the cladding of buildings and themounting of turbines on buildings to also generate power with architecturalvisual blades and not just the standard propeller. There is a different vision that to have many small sources that feed thegrid instead of a dedicated number of large power stations feeding thepower supply. Please call me on 07702059469.

5014,ConnectLater,Thanks for reaching out. You seem to have a pretty decent service I was not even aware of Artera earlier. At the moment we are committed to use a different cloud provider - this is because of special needs for handling US health data HIPAA and certain expectations from customers FIPS-140-2 certified and validated encryption on top of our requirements for providing an uninterrupted service with rolling updates and DDoS resilience. Having said that Artera is not a perfect match for us at the moment but I will keep you in my mind for simpler applications in fact we were running our development environment on a dedicated hosting in Germany similar to Artera and we are just about to virtualize that too. thank yougabor

2130,ConnectLater, Replies are not monitored so please do not email back. Thank you for your email which has been safely received. See estimate below on when to expect a fuller reply. How long will it take AVRillo to replyWhatever your views on the lifting of Covid restrictions many UK lawyers and lenders will continue to take up to a couple of weeks to reply with some search companies taking 12 weeks. This may get worse with expected staff absences as 4. 5 million are estimated to self-isolate with 100000 new Covid cases a day a rise in long Covid and the backlog of work from Covid and the recent stamp duty crisis. Can AVRillo reply faster than a couple of weeksOur award-winning service aims to review your email within 48 hours after which we will email you a time estimate for a fuller reply. If I chase you will you work fasterNo because our award-winning team are used to already working hard often in their own time evenings and weekends to help you move. Just remember their response times are tied by others in the process. Chasing will just slow you down by taking your lawyer away from your legal work. If I shout will you work fasterWe all know the answer is no but also know that as humans we get stressed and sometimes want the impossible. Sadly UK lawyers have seen an increase in cases where they have to stop acting because they are being bullied by unrealistic targets and demands being made of them. Rather than affecting both your and their mental wellbeing please understand you are not alone that moving is stressful and the closer we work together the better your outcome. Whats the  way of keeping in touch Can I get a faster update- Yes simply log into your live 247 portal by using your unique private password and username sent in our very first email to you. - Alternatively just wait for our highly rated automatic updates. You will get one each time we take a key step. - Keep phone calls and emails to a minimum to allow your lawyer to focus on your case. What can I do in an emergencyUse our call surgery to book a personal telephone appointment diary if you are about to exchange complete or dont understand something. We are unique as the only UK Conveyancing legal firm to give you direct access to our lawyers diaries twice a day every working day. Can I dis-instruct if my case is taking longer than your time estimateWhilst we cant do the impossible we do have one of the UKs  track records of hitting time estimates. However we know its frustrating when things are not as fast as you may want duringCovid. As such the regulators ask UK lawyers to explain to clients that they have the choice to dis-instruct and go to another firm. We dont want this but we wont get in your way if you decide to. Can you reassure me even moreOur own personal message is please try not to stress put safety first know you are not alone and try and put things into perspective if you can. Remember it could be worse and that moving is stressful in a Covid environment where for example Prime Ministers Questions in Parliament has predicted millions to self-isolate 100000 new Covid cases a day estimated by the Health secretary Sajid Javid the chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty warning a surge and further waves of coronavirus and the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges warning unprecedented pressure over the coming months.

Cloud migrations have soared over the last year to ensure businesscontinuity and accelerate transformations.Although the public cloud is a central pillar of everyonexe2u20acu2122s digitaltransformation strategy attempting to migrate all applications andinfrastructure to a single cloud provider risks cost overruns and outrightmigration failure.72 of companies who have migrated to the public cloud report that they haverepatriated at least onemajor application on-premise.What your customers need instead is to deploy applications into the bestlocation possible and integrate them across on-premises your private cloudand the public cloud. The market for such hybrid cloud services is growingrapidly and is expected to reach USD 145 billion.The big question is as a data center managed services and private cloudleader are you able to provide this hybrid cloud capabilityIt is extraordinarily difficult to integrate multiple clouds or public cloudswith on-premise and private cloud locations. This requires complexarchitectural components including service discovery monitoring DNSarchitecture network configuration and a variety of other integrations.European MSPs are effortlessly deploying hybrid cloud architectures andupgrading their private cloud capabilities with cutting-edge Kubernetes andcontainer deployments by using ProtoCloud.The platform takes a radically different approach to deploying applications andinfrastructure together whether on-premise into a private cloud the publiccloud or edge locations. It simplifies deployments with pre-integrated toolingand more.ProtoCloud helps companies accelerate migrating and modernizing applicationswithout imposing an all-or-nothing migration or a complete redevelopment. Allthis in a single well-architected platform.If this piques your interest can we ask for 10 minutes in your diary to helpyou offer these capabilities to your customersWarm

3080,ConnectLater,Well to be honest these dont help. SOC2 certificate of your data centers FIPS140-2 certified and validated cipher suites HIPAA compliance are the basic requirements. These are all US specific regulations and on top of that no US PHI data can be moved outside of the USA. To stir it further USA has a terrible network infrastructure. We need at least 3 main data centers and about 20 edge endpoints in order to reach to a meaningful response time after all we are doing soft-realtime EEG recordings. This requires hefty infrastructure dedicated barebone network traffic shaping reverse HTTP Proxying at the edge endpoints to isolate DDoS attacks and so on and so fort. We opted out from using Google and declined using a dedicated offer from IBM and not found Azure a good match either. Said that we are a very picky customer with a hefty expectations not only on the network but also on computing services managed databases multiple storage classes for long time storage rolling updates etc. I am afraid Artera is not in that league as of yet.
