4362,SeekingMoreInfo,Is this a permanent role To change my track would also depend on thesalary and package. I am at present putting the programme together for the power generationplant at the Grange at present but it is not green as it is a diesel  gasplant and was somewhat surprised no green elements are employed like energyfrom waste a wind turbine or solar farm. I was tasked to look at potential workloads in Ireland and I am well awareof the requirements for increased generation required for the data centrespharma projects and distilleries. I know the River Shannon has numbers ofturbines on it and I expect this also could be further improved with moreefficient turbines and installations. This could also be further developedin the UK as a great deal of the mill streams still exist and it is puttingthem back into use instead of powering a mill but generating power. It would also be a point to also look at Elephant grass animal wastemethane and other agri fuels especially in Ireland. I also believe that there is a requirement that all warehouses shouldbecome solar farms and that car parks certainly at services should alsobecome farms allowing for the generation of power to feed electric cars. There are also future requirements in the cladding of buildings and themounting of turbines on buildings to also generate power with architecturalvisual blades and not just the standard propeller. There is a different vision that to have many small sources that feed thegrid instead of a dedicated number of large power stations feeding thepower supply. Please call me on 07702059469.
