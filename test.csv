5492,ConnectLater, Replies are not monitored so please do not email back. Thank you for your email which has been safely received. See estimate below on when to expect a fuller reply. How long will it take AVRillo to replyWhatever your views on the lifting of Covid restrictions many UK lawyers and lenders will continue to take up to a couple of weeks to reply with some search companies taking 12 weeks. This may get worse with expected staff absences as 4. 5 million are estimated to self-isolate with 100000 new Covid cases a day a rise in long Covid and the backlog of work from Covid and the recent stamp duty crisis. Can AVRillo reply faster than a couple of weeksOur award-winning service aims to review your email within 48 hours after which we will email you a time estimate for a fuller reply. If I chase you will you work fasterNo because our award-winning team are used to already working hard often in their own time evenings and weekends to help you move. Just remember their response times are tied by others in the process. Chasing will just slow you down by taking your lawyer away from your legal work. If I shout will you work fasterWe all know the answer is no but also know that as humans we get stressed and sometimes want the impossible. Sadly UK lawyers have seen an increase in cases where they have to stop acting because they are being bullied by unrealistic targets and demands being made of them. Rather than affecting both your and their mental wellbeing please understand you are not alone that moving is stressful and the closer we work together the better your outcome. Whats the  way of keeping in touch Can I get a faster update- Yes simply log into your live 247 portal by using your unique private password and username sent in our very first email to you. - Alternatively just wait for our highly rated automatic updates. You will get one each time we take a key step. - Keep phone calls and emails to a minimum to allow your lawyer to focus on your case. What can I do in an emergencyUse our call surgery to book a personal telephone appointment diary if you are about to exchange complete or dont understand something. We are unique as the only UK Conveyancing legal firm to give you direct access to our lawyers diaries twice a day every working day. Can I dis-instruct if my case is taking longer than your time estimateWhilst we cant do the impossible we do have one of the UKs  track records of hitting time estimates. However we know its frustrating when things are not as fast as you may want duringCovid. As such the regulators ask UK lawyers to explain to clients that they have the choice to dis-instruct and go to another firm. We dont want this but we wont get in your way if you decide to. Can you reassure me even moreOur own personal message is please try not to stress put safety first know you are not alone and try and put things into perspective if you can. Remember it could be worse and that moving is stressful in a Covid environment where for example Prime Ministers Questions in Parliament has predicted millions to self-isolate 100000 new Covid cases a day estimated by the Health secretary Sajid Javid the chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty warning a surge and further waves of coronavirus and the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges warning unprecedented pressure over the coming months.

To do so you may reply to this message.Thank youmarketing@iptp.net------------------------------------------------------------------------------AntonCongratulations Youxe2u20acu2122ve made it successfully through the pandemic havenxe2u20acu2122t lostyour sang froid on all those Zoom calls and have started growing your businessagain. Cloud migrations have soared over the last year to ensure businesscontinuity and accelerate transformations.Although the public cloud is a central pillar of everyonexe2u20acu2122s digitaltransformation strategy attempting to migrate all applications andinfrastructure to a single cloud provider risks cost overruns and outrightmigration failure.72 of companies who have migrated to the public cloud report that they haverepatriated at least onemajor application on-premise.What your customers need instead is to deploy applications into the bestlocation possible and integrate them across on-premises your private cloudand the public cloud. The market for such hybrid cloud services is growingrapidly and is expected to reach USD 145 billion.The big question is as a data center managed services and private cloudleader are you able to provide this hybrid cloud capabilityIt is extraordinarily difficult to integrate multiple clouds or public cloudswith on-premise and private cloud locations. This requires complexarchitectural components including service discovery monitoring DNSarchitecture network configuration and a variety of other integrations.European MSPs are effortlessly deploying hybrid cloud architectures andupgrading their private cloud capabilities with cutting-edge Kubernetes andcontainer deployments by using ProtoCloud.The platform takes a radically different approach to deploying applications andinfrastructure together whether on-premise into a private cloud the publiccloud or edge locations. It simplifies deployments with pre-integrated toolingand more.ProtoCloud helps companies accelerate migrating and modernizing applicationswithout imposing an all-or-nothing migration or a complete redevelopment. Allthis in a single well-architected platform.If this piques your interest can we ask for 10 minutes in your diary to helpyou offer these capabilities to your customersWarm

4639,ConnectLater,Thanks for reaching out. You seem to have a pretty decent service I was not even aware of Artera earlier. At the moment we are committed to use a different cloud provider - this is because of special needs for handling US health data HIPAA and certain expectations from customers FIPS-140-2 certified and validated encryption on top of our requirements for providing an uninterrupted service with rolling updates and DDoS resilience. Having said that Artera is not a perfect match for us at the moment but I will keep you in my mind for simpler applications in fact we were running our development environment on a dedicated hosting in Germany similar to Artera and we are just about to virtualize that too. thank yougabor
