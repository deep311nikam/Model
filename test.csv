3018,SeekingMoreInfo,Thank you for your interest towards my profile.I dont think a position as Process engineer is fitting with my career expectations even though the Project seems quite interesting.
3019,SeekingMoreInfo,Thankyou for keeping me in mind for the role however as you are aware andcan clearly see with this position the pay structure has has alteredsignificantly with IR35.What would have usually been a position of around 5 to 600 per day ltd cois now a 50k a year salary.This is a gap to far to bridge nowadays the take home pay no longerjustifies working away from home.Sadly I feel this is now the new norm and companies are going to expectthe same service from guys like me for half the salary.For me it is far easier to work consultancy earning more staying out ofIR35 and sleeping in my own bed In short these clients are no longer prepared to pay the going rate forguys like me any more this doesnt leave us any alternative other than tofind other revenue streams to suit the experience and qualifications.Infact this role is a perfect example I dare say on 10 hour days workingwith a Saturday the standby fire Watcher and fork lift driver would be onmore earnings than the PM......I would be interested in your thoughts.
3020,ConnectLater,I am currently running a virtual assessment centre so will come back to you as soon as possible.If urgent please contact Jack Smith jsmith@pareto.co.uk.
